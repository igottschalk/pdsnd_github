### Project Title
Bikeshare Data for Chicago, New York and Washington

### Description
The bikeshare is an interactive program with bike sharing data compiled from 3 cities - Chicago, New York and Washington.
Users are asked which city and time period results they want to see. Statistical data is returned and displayed based on the users response.

This includes:
* the most frequent travel times
* the most common month and day of week
* the most popular stations
* trip durations
* riders stats (number of riders, their gender and birth year)

Users are then prompted to see more records or restart the program.

### Files used
