### Project Title
Bikeshare Data for Chicago, New York and Washington

### Description
The bikeshare is an interactive program with bike sharing data compiled from 3 cities - Chicago, New York and Washington.
Users are asked which city and time period results they want to see. Statistical data is returned and displayed based on the users response.
This includes the most frequent travel times, the most common month and day of week, the most popular stations, trip durations, and
riders stats (number of riders, their gender and birth year).
Users are then prompted to see more records or restart the program.
